# A_Level-coursework
The code and write-up I created for my A-Level Computer Science coursework. I completed my coursework throughout the academic year 2018/2019.

The project I created was a database management system (finish description). The write-up is a document made while completing my coursework, and demonstrates the waterfall software development process.

I received 70/70 marks for this coursework. Despite this, there were areas I could have improved on - this I covered in the evaluation section of the write-up.
