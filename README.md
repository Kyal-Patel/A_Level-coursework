# A_Level-coursework
The code and write-up I created for my A-Level Computer Science coursework. I completed my coursework throughout the academic year 2018/2019.

The project I created was a database management system that uses a simplistic GUI to allow the user to manage the database without any prior experience. The write-up is a document made while completing my coursework, and demonstrates the waterfall software development process and includes analysis, design, implementation, testing and evaluation.

I received 70/70 marks for this coursework. Despite this, there were multiple aspects of the code I could have improved on and several things that were left incomplete - this I covered in the evaluation section of the write-up.

I did not use GitHub while working on the project - this repository is here mainly as a way of sharing my work and storing the code and write-up.

Programming language used: Python
Python libraries used:
- Tkinter (for the GUI)
- sqlite3 (Allows you to run SQL commands in python code)
Database used: Custom-made through app "DB Browser for SQLite" - https://sqlitebrowser.org/

To run the program, run the main method located in the file titled "Tuition_Management_System_Class.py".
